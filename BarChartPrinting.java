/* (Bar Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of computers is to display graphs and bar charts. Write an
application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number
of adjacent asterisks. For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******. Display the bars of
asterisks after you read all five numbers.
